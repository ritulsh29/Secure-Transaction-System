# Face Recognition Transaction System

## Project Description 

This project implements an online transaction system with face recognition using Keras and OpenCV, along with data augmentation techniques for enhanced model performance. It incorporates Razorpay as the payment gateway for secure transactions and OTP verification. Django serves as the backend framework.

## Overview

The Face Recognition Transaction System is designed to enhance security and convenience in financial transactions by implementing a face recognition system. This system verifies the identity of users through their facial features and integrates OTP (One Time Password) verification for additional security.

## Architecture of the face recognition model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- CRUD operations to manage user profiles.
- Integration of Razorpay payment gateway for secure transactions.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ritulsh29/Secure-Transaction-System.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights for face recognition.

4. Apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the Django server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Django server.
2. Register your face by following the instructions.
3. Initiate a transaction.
4. The system will verify your identity through face recognition.
5. Enter the OTP received on your registered device to complete the transaction.
